# DogBot UI

This is the frontend interface for DogBot — an early-stage AI assistant that helps humans understand their dogs through empathic dialogue, grounded in instinct theory and behavioral patterns. Built with React, the UI simulates a direct, playful line of communication between human and dog.

---

## Concept

DogBot acts as a translator between species. The interface lets users describe a problem ("Why does my dog bark at children?"), and the agent responds from the dog's perspective. The metaphor: the dog is speaking into a cup-and-string phone — and the human is listening.

The interaction is designed to:
- Encourage curiosity, not control
- Emphasize emotional tone over robotic precision
- Create a non-judgmental space to explore behavior
